manuscripts from the late 8
to the mid 17
century as sources for daily life and social history. A brief introduction to the project is followed by three thematically focused studies that juxtapose the prescriptive prayers in the
with descriptive evidence from other sources: exorcism and other prayers in hagiographical narratives, prayers with relevance to political history, and prayers relating to women’s purity.},

	abstract = {Breast milk is an ideal beverage for rabbinic inquiry. The only quaffable bodily fluid, it is available only for a limited period of time; yet, during that brief period, it is vital
to an infant's life. Further, both the producer and consumer of milk are interstitial, since women/mothers and minors/infants do not fit in the normative rabbinic category of
Jewish adult man. Given these observations, it is startling: (1) how little scholars have written about breastfeeding in rabbinic literature; and (2) how much of this sparse
scholarship treats these texts as if they are straightforward descriptions of lived practice. This article addresses both of these issues. Throughout, I argue that the rabbis use
breast milk as a vehicle for scholastic inquiry into a number of central legal matters.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to introduce a mother-centred mode of feminism – what I have called “matricentric feminism” – consider the context and challenges of a mother-centred feminist theory and politic and to suggest directions for future research. Motherhood, it could be said, is the unfinished business of feminism. A matricentric feminism seeks to make motherhood the business of feminism by positioning mothers’ needs and concerns as the starting point for a theory and politic on and for women’s empowerment. This repositioning is not to suggest that a matricentric feminism should replace traditional feminist thought; rather, it is to emphasize that the category of mother is distinct from the category of woman and that many of the problems mothers face – social, economic, political, cultural, psychological, and so forth – are specific to women’s role and identity as mothers. Indeed, mothers are oppressed under patriarchy as women and as mothers. Consequently, mothers need a matricentric mode of feminism organized from and for their particular identity and work as mothers. Indeed, a mother-centred feminism is needed because mothers – arguably more so than women in general – remain disempowered despite forty years of feminism. My work does not rationalize or defend the need for a mother-centred feminism, as it takes it as a given. Instead, this chapter endeavours to describe and discuss this mode of mother-focused feminism – what I have termed “matricentric feminism” – which has emerged as a result of and in response to women’s specific identities and work as mothers.
A matricentric feminism seeks to make motherhood the business of feminism by positioning mothers’ needs and concerns as the starting point for a theory and politic on and for women’s empowerment. Matricentric feminism, however, has to be incorporated into the field of academic feminism. Over the last forty plus years, many groups of women have argued that mainstream feminism – largely understood to be liberal feminism – has not adequately represented their perspectives or needs. A matricentric perspective is often confused with a maternalist one. Motherhood studies as an area of scholarship, Kawash writes, “is on precarious grounds: ignored by mainstream academic feminism, fragmented and discontinuous in the academic margins”. In making this argument, Kawash uses as her example York University’s refusal to provide institutional funding for The Association for Research on Mothering and the resulting closure of the association in 2010.},

However, despite this medical advice, in many countries breastfeeding rates remain low and in the {UK}, rates are relatively static. The literature on breastfeeding has discussed international rates and the broad socio-economic factors influencing these rates. Through an observational study of a group of breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women in the United Kingdom, this research utilises contemporary theoretical perspectives on the body, space and rites of passage, and investigates the reasons why some breastfeeding mothers may be in a liminal period, and the breastfeeding event itself, at times, a liminal and marginalised act. The paper argues that, for the group studied, breastfeeding is sometimes discouraged by its medicalisation, and that breastmilk and breastfeeding are often considered by mothers to be embarrassing. Many of the women studied regarded certain public and private places to be unacceptable places to breastfeed and claimed to modify their behaviour accordingly. The paper demonstrates the value of conducting locally based qualitative research into breastfeeding experiences, and of using theoretical perspectives from post-medical geography to interpret women's experiences.},
